## Settings

The "Settings" menu item allows for changing several default options. These
settings are automatically stored so that remoTree will re-start with the
settings last used.

There are settings for the default file sorting method and the visibility of
hidden dot files.  These only affect the conditions at startup - the controls
on the views can be used to override these settings.

The remaining options control appearances.  The view scale ratio can be set to
make the content smaller or larger (useful for high-dpi displays). The window
size and position will be restored from the previous session use if enabled.
The final setting selects between light and dark color schemes.
