# System Requirements
---

## Android

remoTree should run on Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) and above.

---

## Linux

remoTree should run on any 64-bit Linux OS.  There is no support for 32-bit
platforms.

The following dependencies are required to build and run remoTree, but the
install script will automatically install them using your native packaging
system:
* Clang
* CMake
* curl
* git
* GTK development headers
* Ninja build
* pkg-config
* XZ development headers

---

## Windows

remoTree should run on Windows 10 and above, 64-bit.  There is no support for
32-bit platforms.

---

## macOS

Due to a lack of Macs for testing, remoTree on macOS is not supported.
Assistance with creating a Mac port would be appreciated.

---

## iOS

Due to a lack of hardware for development and testing, TreeTag on iOS is not
supported.  Assistance with creating an iOS port would be appreciated.
