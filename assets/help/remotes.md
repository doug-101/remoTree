## Remote Connections

remoTree shows lists of available host servers on the Remote Files and Remote
Terminal tab views.  On the initial use, these lists will be blank.  Use the
"+" button at the upper right to add server information.  The Display Name,
User Name and Address are all required fields.  The Private Key button will be
discussed in the next section.  Once those fields are entered, use the check
button at the upper left to complete the host creation.

A tap or click on a host in the list will attempt to make a connection.  It
will prompt for a password if no authentication keys have been defined.  Once
connected, depending on the active tab, the file view or the terminal view
will be active.

The menu button to the right of each host in the list can be used to edit or
delete the host.
