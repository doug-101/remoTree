remoTree is basically a remote file manager.  It can be used for typical file
management tasks on both remote and local file systems, as well as file
transfer.  It also provides access to a command line shell on the remote
system.

remoTree is primarily intended to be used from Android systems, but it can
also be run from Linux or Windows operating systems.  Remote systems must be
running a SSH sever, since SSH/SFTP is used for the connection.
